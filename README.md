# LAB - Class 04
## Project: Garage Band with OOP
## Author: Mandela Steele-Dadzie

### Setup:

VENV Creation: python3 -m venv .venv
VENV Activation: source .venv/bin/activate

Initialize App: python3 -m band

### Tests:

This was a fantastic lesson in reviewing the tests beforehand and using those to drive your development. I did not do this and implemented all features before going back and looking at test requirements.
This led me to need to refactor several parts of my code, and got me stuck on a momenclature difference between my code and the test - an easy fix that took a long time to find and could have been avoided if I had looked a the tests beforehand!

### Notes/Credits:
I was able to use ChatGPT to resolve an issue in my tests where all former band instances should have been in an instances list, whereas I had them in an all_bands list.
